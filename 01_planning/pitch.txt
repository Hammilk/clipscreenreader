Semantic Web Scraper
Problem:
    Web Scraping is inaccessible to the average person
    Web Scraping for people, narrow in scope
Solution:
    Example -> User requests if any new concerts are in st. louis -> request
    request -> LLM -> .json {relevant domains what are you looking for}
    webscraper(.json, .json[domain]) -> output.json(what you looking for)
    user can define/automate custom webscraper with ease
